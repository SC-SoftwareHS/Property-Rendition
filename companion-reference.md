# RenditionReady — Companion Reference

## Appendix A: Market and Compliance Context

- Business personal property (BPP) renditions are required in **38 states plus Washington D.C.**
- Filing deadlines are jurisdiction-specific; for example, Texas has an April 15 deadline.
- Failure to file triggers a **10% penalty** on total taxes owed; filing a false report incurs a **50% penalty**.
- Only **37% of companies** use any property tax software today — 63% file manually.

## Appendix E: Expansion Priorities

- Launch baseline: Texas, Oklahoma, Florida (398 counties)
- Expand to remaining 35 BPP states, prioritized by market size, starting with Georgia, California, Illinois (Chicago only), Virginia, and North Carolina

## Appendix F: Competitive Landscape (High Level)

- PPP is the low-end incumbent: desktop-only, no cloud access, and explicit data-export lock-in.
- Enterprise platforms like Avalara and Ryan/ONESOURCE target Fortune 500 companies and cost tens of thousands annually.
- The "missing middle" (roughly 5–500 renditions) lacks a modern, affordable solution.
