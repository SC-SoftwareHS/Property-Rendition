# RenditionReady — Go-to-Market Marketing Plan

## Executive Summary

RenditionReady is a cloud-based SaaS that automates business personal property (BPP) tax renditions for CPA firms across Texas, Oklahoma, and Florida. The primary competitor — Personal Property Pro (PPP) — is a 19-year-old Windows desktop app built on Microsoft Access with no meaningful innovation since ~2007. The market is small but durable, with an estimated TAM of $500K–$1.5M for a modern SaaS tool. The product is 90–95% complete. The bottleneck is now sales, not engineering.

## 1. Target Customer Profiles

### Tier 1: CPA Firms Filing Renditions as a Service (Primary)
- Small to mid-size CPA firms (2–25 employees) in TX, OK, FL
- Currently file BPP renditions for 10–200+ business clients annually
- Pain points: manual data entry, Excel spreadsheets, outdated PPP software, county form variations, depreciation table lookups
- Decision maker: Managing partner or tax department lead
- Budget: $300–$1,500/year for rendition-specific tooling
- **These are the customers PPP has today. You are taking their lunch.**

### Tier 2: Property Tax Consulting Firms
- Firms like Gill Denson, Tax Advisors Group, Popp Hutcheson (smaller ones)
- File high volumes of renditions as their core business
- More sophisticated needs (FMV overrides, protest support, audit trails)
- Higher willingness to pay — Professional or Firm tier
- **Longer sales cycle but higher LTV**

### Tier 3: Multi-Location Businesses Filing Their Own Renditions
- Restaurant chains, franchise operators, equipment-heavy businesses
- File renditions across multiple counties/states
- Usually handled by an in-house controller or outsourced to a CPA
- **Lower priority — pursue after establishing CPA firm traction**

## 2. How to Build the Prospect List

### Source 1: County Appraisal District Agent Rosters (Highest Value)
When a CPA files renditions on behalf of clients, they file an **Appointment of Agent form (Form 50-162)** with the county appraisal district. Many CADs make these records public or available via public records request.

**Action steps:**
- Call Harris County Appraisal District (713-957-7800) — ask if authorized agent lists for BPP renditions are publicly available or requestable
- Submit public information requests to the top 10 Texas CADs:
  - Harris County (Houston)
  - Dallas County
  - Tarrant County (Fort Worth)
  - Bexar County (San Antonio)
  - Travis County (Austin)
  - Collin County (Plano/McKinney)
  - Denton County
  - Fort Bend County
  - Williamson County
  - El Paso County
- This gives you a list of **CPAs who are definitively filing renditions today** — not cold leads, warm leads

### Source 2: LinkedIn Search
- Search: CPA + "property tax" or "business personal property" or "rendition" in TX/OK/FL
- Search: CPA firm profiles that list "property tax compliance" in their services
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator if budget allows ($99/mo) for advanced filtering
- **Target: Build a list of 200+ CPA profiles**

### Source 3: Texas State Board of Public Accountancy
- Public CPA lookup at tsbpa.texas.gov
- Can search by city/region
- Cross-reference with firm websites that mention property tax or rendition services

### Source 4: CPA Practice Advisor Directory
- CPAs who read CPA Practice Advisor are the type who evaluate software tools
- Browse their directory and content for firms that engage with property tax content

### Source 5: Google Search — Firm by Firm
- Search: `"business personal property" rendition CPA [city]` for each major metro
- Search: `"property tax" "rendition" site:linkedin.com CPA Texas`
- Firms that mention renditions on their website are self-identifying as your target

### Source 6: HCAD Rendition Workshop Attendee Lists
- Harris County holds annual rendition workshops (in-person and virtual)
- Attend these events to network directly with CPAs and business owners
- Ask HCAD if past attendee lists are available

### Prospect List Target: 200–500 qualified contacts across all sources

## 3. Messaging & Positioning

### Core Positioning Statement
> RenditionReady is the modern, cloud-based alternative to Personal Property Pro. File business personal property renditions for Texas, Oklahoma, and Florida from anywhere — with accurate depreciation, county-specific forms, and multi-client management built for how CPA firms actually work today.

### Key Differentiators vs. Personal Property Pro

| What They Have | What You Have |
|---|---|
| Windows-only desktop app | Cloud-based — works on any device, anywhere |
| Microsoft Access database | Modern Postgres database with real-time sync |
| Per-client passwords | Role-based access control (admin/reviewer/preparer) |
| Manual install & updates | Always up to date, nothing to install |
| Single-user workflow | Multi-user with team invites and role management |
| PayPal/check payments | Self-serve Stripe billing with free trial |
| Rigid import format | Smart CSV/XLSX import with 40+ column auto-mapping |
| No HB9 support (unconfirmed) | Full HB9 exemption handling for TX 2026 |
| Batch print | Batch PDF/ZIP download with cover letters |
| ~$350/year for 10 clients | $29/month for 25 clients (saves money AND does more) |

### Messaging by Channel

**LinkedIn DM (cold outreach):**
> Hi [Name] — I noticed your firm handles business personal property renditions in [county/state]. I built a cloud-based alternative to Personal Property Pro that handles TX, OK, and FL forms with auto-depreciation and batch PDF generation. Would you be open to a 10-minute call? Happy to offer free access so you can kick the tires. No strings attached.

**Email (cold outreach):**
> Subject: Still using Excel (or PPP) for BPP renditions?
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm reaching out because your firm handles business personal property renditions in [state] — and I built something that might save your team serious time this season.
>
> RenditionReady is a cloud-based tool purpose-built for BPP renditions across Texas, Oklahoma, and Florida. It handles county-specific forms (50-144, 901, DR-405), auto-calculates depreciation, supports bulk import from Excel, and generates print-ready PDFs — including the new HB9 exemption logic for Texas 2026.

> It's basically what Personal Property Pro would be if someone rebuilt it from scratch for 2026.
>
> I'm offering free access to a handful of CPA firms this season. Would you be open to a quick call this week?
>

> [Your name]

**Email (to known PPP users):**
> Subject: Cloud-based alternative to Personal Property Pro
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> If your firm uses Personal Property Pro for BPP renditions, I'd love 10 minutes of your time. I built a modern, cloud-based replacement that covers all the same counties in TX, OK, and FL — but runs in your browser, supports multiple users, and handles the new Texas HB9 exemption.
>
> No download, no Access database, no Windows dependency.
>
> I'm looking for 5 firms to try it this season and give me honest feedback. Access is free — I just want to know if it solves the right problems.
>
> Would you be open to a quick demo?

**Facebook Group Post (CPA/tax professional groups):**
> Question for anyone who files BPP renditions in Texas, Oklahoma, or Florida — what are you currently using? Personal Property Pro? Excel? Something else?
>
> I've been building a cloud-based rendition tool and I'm looking for beta testers. Covers all counties in all three states, auto-depreciation, batch PDF export, HB9 support. Free access for early users.
>
> DM me if you're interested or just curious.

**CPA Practice Advisor pitch (editorial/product listing):**
> Pitch angle: "A solo developer built a cloud-based competitor to 19-year-old desktop rendition software in 2 days using AI coding tools — and it might be better."
>
> This is a story about: AI-assisted development, disrupting legacy niche software, the specific pain of BPP renditions, and HB9 compliance for 2026.

## 4. Channel Strategy & Timing

### Channel Priority (Ranked)

1. **Direct outreach via LinkedIn + email** — highest conversion, most control
2. **County agent roster mining** — highest quality leads, requires legwork upfront
3. **CPA society chapter events** — relationship building, slower but durable
4. **CPA Practice Advisor listing/article** — credibility and inbound
5. **Facebook groups** — low effort, can generate early beta testers
6. **HCAD rendition workshops** — in-person networking with exact target audience
7. **Google Ads** — low volume keywords but highly intentional searchers (later)
8. **Content marketing / SEO** — long game, not the priority for first 10 customers

### Timing Calendar

| Month | Activity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Feb 2026** | Build prospect list (agent rosters, LinkedIn, Google). Fix blockers (legal pages, tier limits, error states, deploy to production). | Rendition season is active — CPAs are too busy to switch now, but you can identify them. |
| **Mar 2026** | Continue list building. Attend HCAD rendition workshop. Soft outreach to 20 CPAs offering free parallel testing ("try it alongside your current process"). | Some CPAs are wrapping up early filers. You can catch them post-crunch. |
| **Apr 2026** | TX deadline (Apr 15). Monitor any beta testers. Collect feedback. | Do NOT hard-sell during deadline week. Be helpful, not pushy. |
| **May 2026 ★** | **Primary outreach window opens.** Rendition season just ended. CPAs are exhausted and reflecting on pain points. Send 100+ emails. LinkedIn blitz. Post in Facebook groups. Pitch CPA Practice Advisor. | This is when CPAs are most receptive to "there has to be a better way." |
| **Jun–Jul 2026** | Follow up on all May outreach. Demo to interested firms. Offer annual pricing discount for early adopters. | Convert interest into trials and trials into paid. |
| **Aug–Sep 2026** | Collect testimonials from early users. Build case studies. Attend state CPA society events (TX, OK, FL). | Social proof for the next wave. |
| **Oct–Dec 2026** | Pre-season outreach for 2027 cycle. "Get set up before January so you're ready for rendition season." | CPAs plan their tooling in Q4 for the coming year. |
| **Jan 2027 ★** | **Second major outreach window.** FL tangible property returns due Apr 1. OK Form 901 due Mar 15. TX due Apr 15. Firms are gearing up. | This is when new tool adoption happens — before the crunch, not during it. |

### The Two Golden Windows
1. **Late April – June** (post-deadline recovery): "That was painful. Here's a better way for next year."
2. **October – January** (pre-season planning): "Get ready for rendition season with a modern tool."

**Avoid hard-selling:** January 15 – April 15 (CPAs are in the trenches and won't switch mid-season)

## 5. Pricing Strategy for Customer Acquisition

### Launch Pricing Recommendation

**Lead with the Starter tier ($29/month)** — this is your wedge. PPP charges $350/year for their CPA Lite plan (10 clients). Your Starter at $29/month ($348/year) gives them 25 clients, cloud access, and a modern UI at roughly the same annual cost. It's an easy "try it and see" decision.

### Early Adopter Offers

- **Free access through April 2026** for any CPA firm willing to test alongside their current process
- **50% off the first year** for firms that convert to paid before July 2026
- **Annual billing discount** — offer $249/year for Starter (vs. $348 monthly billing) to compete directly with PPP's $350

### Upgrade Path
- Starter firms that grow beyond 25 clients naturally upgrade to Professional ($79/mo)
- Firms that want team access (multiple preparers) need Professional
- The Firm tier ($149/mo) is for larger operations — don't lead with this

### Pricing Objection Handling
- "PPP is cheaper" → PPP Lite is $350/year for 10 clients. Your Starter is $348/year for 25 clients with cloud access and multi-user. It's not cheaper — it's more limited.
- "I can just use Excel" → You can. But can your staff? Can you batch-generate county-specific PDFs from Excel? Can you roll forward 200 clients year-over-year in Excel?
- "What if my county doesn't accept your forms?" → We use the official state forms (50-144, 901, DR-405). If a county has custom requirements, we want to know — our goal is 100% county acceptance.

## 7. Content & SEO (Long Game)

These are not priorities for the first 10 customers, but they build compounding value over time.

### Blog Posts to Write (Post-Launch)
- "How to File a Business Personal Property Rendition in Texas (2026 Guide)"
- "Texas HB9 Explained: The New $125K BPP Exemption for 2026"
- "Personal Property Pro vs. RenditionReady: Cloud vs. Desktop for BPP Renditions"
- "Oklahoma Form 901: Complete Filing Guide for CPA Firms"
- "Florida DR-405: What CPA Firms Need to Know"
- "How to Import Your Fixed Asset List into RenditionReady (CSV/Excel Guide)"

### SEO Keywords to Target
- "business personal property rendition software"
- "personal property pro alternative"
- "Texas BPP rendition tool"
- "Form 50-144 software"
- "Oklahoma Form 901 software"
- "Florida DR-405 software"
- "cloud rendition software CPA"
- "HB9 business personal property exemption 2026"

### Google Ads (Low Budget, High Intent)
- These keywords have almost zero competition because the niche is so small
- Even $10/day on Google Ads targeting "business personal property rendition software" could capture the few people actively searching
- Set up after you have a production landing page with a clear CTA

---

## 8. Competitive Intelligence — Ongoing

### Monitor PPP
- Check personalpropertypro.com quarterly for pricing or feature changes
- Download their free demo annually to compare features
- Watch for any response to your market entry (unlikely given their track record)

### Monitor Avalara Property Tax
- Avalara is the enterprise player in this space
- They serve large corporations with thousands of locations
- They are NOT your competitor for small CPA firms — their pricing and complexity is overkill
- But watch for any downmarket moves

### Monitor County E-Filing Trends
- Some counties are moving toward electronic rendition submission
- Harris County has an online portal for renditions
- If counties build e-filing APIs, building integration would be a massive moat
- Track which counties accept electronic submissions and prioritize those

---

## 9. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| County rejects your PDF output | Test with Harris, Dallas, and Bexar counties before selling. Have a rapid-response process to fix form issues. |
| Depreciation tables are wrong | Get CPA verification for OK and FL tables before any paid customer uses them. TX tables cite official PTAD source. |
| CPAs won't switch mid-season | Don't try to convert mid-season. Offer free parallel testing, convert for next year's cycle. |
| PPP drops their price | Unlikely after 19 years of no innovation. Even if they do, you win on features (cloud, multi-user, HB9). |
| Market is too small | Set a hard stop: if you can't get 5 trials in 30 days of active outreach, re-evaluate. Don't spend 6 months hoping. |
| Shiny object syndrome | Commit to 90 days. Put it in writing. Tell someone. No new projects until Day 90. |
