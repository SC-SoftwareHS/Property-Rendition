**To:** [COUNTY CAD PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER EMAIL]
**Subject:** Public Information Request — Authorized Agent Roster (Form 50-162)

Dear Public Information Officer,

Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Texas Government Code, Chapter 552), I am requesting the following information:

**A list or report of all authorized agents (Form 50-162 — Appointment of Agent for Property Tax Matters) currently on file with the [COUNTY NAME] Central Appraisal District for business personal property accounts.**

Specifically, I am requesting the following fields for each active agent authorization:

1. Agent name
2. Agent firm/company name
3. Agent mailing address
4. Agent phone number
5. Number of accounts represented (if readily available)

I am **not** requesting any rendition data, property values, financial information, or any information protected under Texas Tax Code Section 22.27. I am only requesting the publicly available administrative data from the agent appointment forms.

I understand that under the Public Information Act, you must respond within 10 business days. I am happy to receive this information electronically (spreadsheet, CSV, or PDF) to minimize any cost to the district.

If there are any charges associated with this request, please notify me in advance. I consent to charges up to $50 without prior approval.

Please send the responsive records to: harrison@sylvanitecapital.com

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Harrison Stoneham

## Notes

- The PIA requires response within **10 business days**
- If they try to charge more than $50, they must notify you first
- If they claim this is confidential, push back — Form 50-162 agent data is NOT rendition data and is NOT protected under Tax Code 22.27
- If they refer to the AG's office, that's fine — it adds delay but typically resolves in your favor
- The real prize is Harris and Dallas counties — those will have the highest volume of CPA agents
- You can also request this from Oklahoma and Florida counties, but start with Texas
